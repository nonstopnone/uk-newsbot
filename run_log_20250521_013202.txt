TITLE: Student suicide review says unis must act to stop more deaths | UK News
LINK: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq855x0gk3xo
BODY:
Universities in England have been told to step up efforts to prevent student suicides, in a review commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE).

A report, which has been in the works for nearly two years, says they should assess the safety of student halls and involve families more after a student has died.

Its recommendations, which are the first to ever be issued to university leaders by any UK government, include discouraging the laying of flowers where a student has died if it could draw attention to a "suicide location".
