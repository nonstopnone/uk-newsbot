An exotic dancer called The Punisher discovered his client's identity when he turned on a hotel television before an encounter and the screen said, "Welcome Sean Combs".

Sharay Hayes testified at the hip-hop mogul's sex-trafficking trial that he was hired to create "sexy, erotic scenes" with Combs' then-girlfriend Casandra "Cassie" Ventura while a naked man watched from the corner.

But he did not realise at first that the man was Mr Combs. That changed when Mr Hayes was waiting for his clients in a luxury hotel suite and saw his name on the television's welcome screen.

Johnpaul began using nicotine pouches to help him get off vapes – but says it just led to another addiction.

At one stage he was using 15 pouches a day, although the 16-year-old has now cut back to five.

Health experts say the pouches – small sachets that fit between the top lip and the gum, nicknamed "snus" by some teenagers - are addictive and may have other harmful side effects.

**Quote:**

Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House.

In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms.

Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier.

**Quote:**

Five yards out from an unguarded net, it was the moment made for Kevin De Bruyne to sign off with a goal in front of Manchester City fans for the final time. Instead, the greatest midfielder of the Premier League generation somehow produced a miss for the ages.

It was nothing like the previous 420 games for City, when De Bruyne was as close to perfection as a midfielder could be. Splitting defences with a pass, scoring himself driving his team into the dangerous areas of opponents.

There were still a few signs of the old De Bruyne: that cross from the inside-right to the far post. Or sending Erling Haaland behind the back line. Or a free-kick that tested Bournemouth. But nothing quite came off and it would not be a scoring send-off for the Belgian, who leaves this summer with six league titles and a European Cup.
