BODY:
A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumours from weeks to just hours, researchers say.

Surgeons have described the "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing as a "game  changer" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients.

The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH).

TITLE: Thames Water halts bosses bonus scheme
LINK: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3300yyyno
BODY:
Thames Water has decided to "pause" its scheme to pay out big bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its £3bn rescue loan.

The decision comes after Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable".

The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting £1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses.
