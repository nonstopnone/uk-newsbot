Johnpaul began using nicotine pouches to help him get off vapes – but says it just led to another addiction.

At one stage he was using 15 pouches a day, although the 16-year-old has now cut back to five.

Health experts say the pouches – small sachets that fit between the top lip and the gum, nicknamed "snus" by some teenagers - are addictive and may have other harmful side effects.

**Quote:**

Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House.

In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms.

Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier.
