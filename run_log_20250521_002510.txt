TITLE: World-first gonorrhoea vaccine launched by NHS England as infections soar | UK News
LINK: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cded26z16leo
BODY:
England will be the first country in the world to start vaccinating people against the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea.

It will not be available for everyone. The focus will mainly be on gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or an STI.

The vaccine is 30-40% effective, but NHS England hopes it will reverse soaring numbers of infections.
