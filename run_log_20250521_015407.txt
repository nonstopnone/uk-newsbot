BODY:
The Labour Party has postponed its annual Women's Conference in the wake of advice following last month's ruling on the legal definition of a woman.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.

Up until the ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in "positive action" measures such as all-women shortlists.

In a makeshift tent in al-Shati refugee camp, in the north of the Gaza Strip, 33-year-old Enas Abu Daqqa holds her tiny baby daughter Niveen in her arms. A fan hums constantly behind her to break the morning heat.

Enas worries that Niveen's health might deteriorate at any point. She is only seven months old, and was born during the war with a hole in her heart.

As her mother explains how she struggled to keep her alive amid a collapsing health system in Gaza, Niveen, with her big brown eyes and tiny frame, cries and fidgets.

At just 37 hectares, the Philippines-controlled island of Pagasa – or "hope" - is smaller than Buckingham Palace. There is almost nothing there.

The 300 or so inhabitants live in a cluster of small, wooden houses. They fish in the clear, turquoise waters, and grow what vegetables they can in the sandy ground.

But they are not alone in these disputed waters: just off shore, to the west, lies an armada of ships.

Giving evidence on Tuesday, the seventh day of the trial, Regina Ventura said she did not initially understand the email Cassie sent her in December 2011, saying, "The sex tape threw me, [Diddy] was trying to hurt my daughter."

BODY:
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for Syria's transitional authorities to be supported, warning that the country could be only weeks away from "potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions".

At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he defended President Donald Trump's decision last week to lift sanctions on Syria before meeting President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December.

Trump's rationale was that other countries wanted to help Sharaa's administration and send aid but were afraid of the sanctions, Rubio explained.

An exotic dancer called The Punisher discovered his client's identity when he turned on a hotel television before an encounter and the screen said, "Welcome Sean Combs".

Sharay Hayes testified at the hip-hop mogul's sex-trafficking trial that he was hired to create "sexy, erotic scenes" with Combs' then-girlfriend Casandra "Cassie" Ventura while a naked man watched from the corner.

But he did not realise at first that the man was Mr Combs. That changed when Mr Hayes was waiting for his clients in a luxury hotel suite and saw his name on the television's welcome screen.

BODY:
As Kevin De Bruyne bid farewell to fans after his final match at the Etihad Stadium, the tears were rolling down the cheeks of Pep Guardiola. The great managers have great players, according to Guardiola himself, so the picture of modern football’s most successful coach crying tells its own story.

De Bruyne, with his family next to him, was welling up himself after his last home appearance forManchester City. He was presented with a lifelong season ticket by the family of Colin Bell, whose membership in the hall of fame has been long-established and is now joined by the shy, ginger-haired Belgian who became the finest midfielder in the Premier League.

“When you have lived in this love for a decade, there is nothing else better than that,” said Guardiola. “It is a sad day and he will be missed. There are players that are irreplaceable. It is the connection and year by year providing what people love. I’m not sure who he supported before but I’m pretty sure now he is a Man City fan forever.”

BODY:
Universities in England have been told to step up efforts to prevent student suicides, in a review commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE).

A report, which has been in the works for nearly two years, says they should assess the safety of student halls and involve families more after a student has died.

Its recommendations, which are the first to ever be issued to university leaders by any UK government, include discouraging the laying of flowers where a student has died if it could draw attention to a "suicide location".

In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms.

Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier.

Millions of shoppers could get up to £70 each after a tribunal approved a settlement in a lawsuit against Mastercard which stemmed from historic fees levied on businesses by the card provider.

The decision comes after a long-running legal case going back almost a decade, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman.

Walter Merricks argued that shoppers were charged higher prices after fees were wrongly levied on transactions made over a 15-year period between 1992 and 2008.

The US has selected a design for the futuristic "Golden Dome" missile defence system, says US President Donald Trump, adding that it will be operational by the end of his time in office.

Just days after returning to the White House in January, Trump unveiled his intentions for the system, aimed at countering "next-generation" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.

An initial sum of $25bn (£18.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it will end up costing much more than that over decades.
