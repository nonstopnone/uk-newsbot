**Quote:**

The UK has suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers, as Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the military escalation in Gaza as "morally unjustifiable".

The move follows warnings of starvation in Gaza after Israel launched a new military operation over the weekend.

There were fiery exchanges in Parliament with Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who suggested the actions would be welcomed by Hamas, but also angry calls for the government to go further.

**Quote:**

An exotic dancer called The Punisher discovered his client's identity when he turned on a hotel television before an encounter and the screen said, "Welcome Sean Combs".

Sharay Hayes testified at the hip-hop mogul's sex-trafficking trial that he was hired to create "sexy, erotic scenes" with Combs' then-girlfriend Casandra "Cassie" Ventura while a naked man watched from the corner.

But he did not realise at first that the man was Mr Combs. That changed when Mr Hayes was waiting for his clients in a luxury hotel suite and saw his name on the television's welcome screen.

**Quote:**

The Labour Party has postponed its annual Women's Conference in the wake of advice following last month's ruling on the legal definition of a woman.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.

Up until the ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in "positive action" measures such as all-women shortlists.

**Quote:**

At just 37 hectares, the Philippines-controlled island of Pagasa â€“ or "hope" - is smaller than Buckingham Palace. There is almost nothing there.

The 300 or so inhabitants live in a cluster of small, wooden houses. They fish in the clear, turquoise waters, and grow what vegetables they can in the sandy ground.

But they are not alone in these disputed waters: just off shore, to the west, lies an armada of ships.

**Quote:**

Five yards out from an unguarded net, it was the moment made for Kevin De Bruyne to sign off with a goal in front of Manchester City fans for the final time. Instead, the greatest midfielder of the Premier League generation somehow produced a miss for the ages.

It was nothing like the previous 420 games for City, when De Bruyne was as close to perfection as a midfielder could be. Splitting defences with a pass, scoring himself driving his team into the dangerous areas of opponents.

There were still a few signs of the old De Bruyne: that cross from the inside-right to the far post. Or sending Erling Haaland behind the back line. Or a free-kick that tested Bournemouth. But nothing quite came off and it would not be a scoring send-off for the Belgian, who leaves this summer with six league titles and a European Cup.
